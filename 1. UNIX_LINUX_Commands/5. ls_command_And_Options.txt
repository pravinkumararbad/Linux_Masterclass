Commands:
---------

1. ls command (list):
---------------------
List out all files and directories provided in the given directory.
If we are not providing any directory then it will list out in current working directory.

- List all files and directories present under directory dir1.
  $ ls dir1

- List all files and directories present under current directory.
  $ ls
  
- VVIMP: In Linux we can use manual pages as help also known as man pages.
  $ man <command>
  $ man ls
  
  $ man ls > ls_doc.txt (redirection)

Various options for ls command:
-------------------------------
1. ls:
   It will list all the files and directories in current working directory in alphabetical order.

2. ls -r
   It will display all the files and directories in current working directory in reverse alphabetical order.

3. ls -l
   To display in long listing form.
   -rw-r--r-- <n> <user/owner name> <group name> <size of file> <created/last mod time> <name of the file>
   
   First char describes type of file.
   Remaining nine chars describe the permissions of the file.
   <n>: The number of link files

4. ls -t
   It will display all the files and directories in pwd with respect to creation or last modified time.
   Most recent will be at the top and old are at bottom.

   VVIMP: ls -l -t / ls -lt: This will combine lost listing with creation / last modified time.
5. ls -ltr
   This command will combine all three features, this will take files in long listing form, with creation time from old to latest.

NOTE: We can combine multiple options and order of the options is not important.

6. ls -a
   This will list all the directories and files in pwd including hidden files.
   ls | wc -l
   ls -a | wc -l
   These commands will definetly give us different output as (ls -a) returns the hidden files aswell.

7. ls -A (almost all)
   This will list almost all the directories and files in pwd including hidden files except (., ..).

8. ls -F
   To display all the files by type.
   /: Directory
   *: Executable
   @: Link file

9. ls -f
   List all files including hidden files, but disable the color conventions.

10. ls -i / ls -ltri
    To display all files including inode number.
	inode is index node. Address of location where file attributes are stored.
	An inode (index node) is a data structure used by Linux filesystems (like ext4) to store information about a file or directory, except its name and actual content.
	This inode stores:
    File type, Permissions, Owner (UID), Group (GID), File size, Timestamps, Link count, Disk block pointers

11. ls -R
    R means recursive.

12. ls -s
    s means size. Number of blocks used. 1 block means 1 Kb or 4Kb.

13. ls -h / ls -lh
    h means human readable form.
	This is meaningful mostly when we are using this with -l. This shows memory size correctly.

14. ls -l /etc | head
    head is used to show only top 10 lines of the huge file list.

	ls -l /etc | head -20 (This shows top 20 entries)
	ls -l /etc | head -50 (This shows top 50 entries)

15. ls -l /etc | tail
    tail is used to show only last 10 lines of the huge file list.
    
	ls -l /etc | tail -20 (This shows last 20 entries)
	ls -l /etc | tail -3 (This shows last 3 entries)

16. ls -l /etc | more
    List all files in page by page format in forward direction.

17. ls -l /etc | less
    List all files in page by page format in forward and backward both direction.


Exercise:
---------
Q: All files including hidden files with their inode numbers?
   ls -lai or ls -ai

Q: Long listing of all files including hidden files sorted by modification date (oldest to latest).
   ls -latr

NOTE:
ls -r
ls -rt

These two commands are not same as,
-r will always show the list of files in reverse alphabetical order.
-rt will always show the list of files in reverse creation or modification time order.

Q: How to identify a hidden file?
   Hidden file name starts with a (.).
