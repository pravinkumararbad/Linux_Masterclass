Comparing File Content:
-----------------------
We can compare data of two files by using following commands.

1. cmp
2. diff
3. sdiff
4. vidiff
5. comm

1. cmp command:
---------------
It will compare files byte by byte.

syntax:
-------
cmp file1.txt file2.txt
If the content is same then we do not get any output.
If content is different, then it provides information about only first difference byte number and line number is provided.

Example:
--------
Comparing Same File:
--------------------
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ gedit file1.txt
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ cat file1.txt 
First Line
Second Line
Third Line
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ cp file1.txt file2.txt
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ cmp file1.txt file2.txt 
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$

Comparing Diff File:
--------------------
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ gedit file2.txt 
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ cat file2.txt 
First Line
Second Line
Third Line
Something
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ cmp file1.txt file2.txt
cmp: EOF on file1.txt after byte 34, line 3

infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ gedit file1.txt 
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ cat file1.txt 
First Line
Second Line
Third Line
Some
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ cmp file1.txt file2.txt
file1.txt file2.txt differ: byte 39, line 4

NOTE: cmp command will not show all differences and it will only show first difference.

2. diff command:
----------------
diff command will be used to compare two files to show all the differences.

Syntax:
-------
diff file1.txt file2.txt

There is no output if the content in both the files is same.
If the content is different it shows all the differences.

Example:
--------
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ cmp file1.txt file1.txt 
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ diff file1.txt file2.txt 
4c4
< Some
---
> Something

4c4 denotes (first file line change second file line)

Options for diff command:
-------------------------
-q -> Shows message if file is different
-s -> shows message if the file is same or identical.
-y -> shows comparison line by line (parallel comparison).

infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ cp file1.txt file2.txt 
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ cp file1.txt file3.txt
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ gedit file3.txt 
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ cat file3.txt 
First Line
Second Line
Third Line
Some
thing

option -q:
----------
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ diff file1.txt file3.txt -q
Files file1.txt and file3.txt differ

option -s:
----------
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ diff file1.txt file2.txt -s
Files file1.txt and file2.txt are identical

option -y:
----------
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ diff file1.txt file3.txt -y
First Line							First Line
Second Line							Second Line
Third Line							Third Line
Some								Some
							      >	thing

We can use --seuppress-common-lines with -y to suppress common lines:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ diff file1.txt file3.txt -y --suppress-common-lines
							      >	thing
                                  
3. sdiff command:
-----------------
Here s means side by side comparison.
This is as good as using -y option with diff command.

syntax and example:
-------------------
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ sdiff file1.txt file3.txt 
First Line							First Line
Second Line							Second Line
Third Line							Third Line
Some								Some
							      >	thing
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ sdiff file1.txt file3.txt --suppress-common-lines
							      >	thing

4. vimdiff command:
-------------------
It will highlight all differences in vim editor.
vim editor must be installed when we are using vimdiff.

install vim editor
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ sudo apt install vim

syntax and example:
-------------------
vimdiff file1.txt file2.txt

We will see two windows showing the differences.
ctrl+w+w --> Go to next window
:q --> To close the current window
:qa --> To close all windows
:qa! --> To close all windows forcefully.

5. comm command:
----------------
By using this command we can compare data of two files.
We will see the result in three columns.
column1 -> Data present only in file1 but not in file2
column2 -> Data present only in file2 but not in file1
column3 -> Common data in both files.

syntax and example:
-------------------
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ comm file1.txt file3.txt 
                First Line
                Second Line
                Third Line
                Some
        thing
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ cat file1.txt 
First Line
Second Line
Third Line
Some
infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ cat file3.txt 
First Line
Second Line
Third Line
Some
thing

NOTE: The files must be in sorted order to have a proper output using comm command.

Options for comm command:
-------------------------
-1 -> If we do not want to display column 1
-2 -> If we do not want to display column 2
-3 -> If we do not want to display column 3
-12 -> If we do not want to display columns 1 and 2
-13 -> If we do not want to display columns 1 and 3
-23 -> If we do not want to display columns 2 and 3
