Topic-1: Overview of Linux/Unix OS

What is UNIX?
-------------
It is an operating system created in 1960s.
With a lot of extensions and improvements to base version of UNIX, several flavours introduced by organization.
E.g. RedHat Linux, Ubuntu, Suse, etc.

Characteristics of UNIX:
------------------------
1. It is a freeware.
2. It is a open source software. FOSS (Freeware and Open Source Software)
3. It is multi user operating system.
4. It is multi tasking operating system.
5. It is user friendly and supports both CUI based and GUI.
6. It is more secure than windows operating system.

Flavours of UNIX:
-----------------
As UNIX is open source operating system, multiple flavours are available with lot of extensions and improvements.
E.g.: Ubuntu, RedHat, Cent OS, Fedora, Slackware, Open Solaris, Kali, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server ( SLSE )

Components of UNIX:
-------------------
There are 2 important components of UNIX
1. Shell
2. Kernel

1. Shell
--------
User can communicate with Shell, it is an outer layer of OS. User can communicate with Shell only.
Shell reads commands provided by user.
Shell will check is it valid command or not.
Shell will check is it properly used or not.
If everything is proper, then shell interprets/converts that command into kernel understandable form and handover that to the kernel.
Shell acts as interface between user and kernel.

2. Kernel
---------
Kernel is a core component of UNIX OS.
Kernel is responsible to execute our commands with the help of hardware components.
Memory allocation, processor allocation is taken care by the Kernel.
It acts as interface between shell and hardware components.

Command Execution Flow:
-----------------------
											End User Types a command on Terminal
											      E.g. touch myFile.txt
												            |
															|
											Command will be submitted to Shell
											                |
															|
									   Shell checks whether this command is valid or  -->  If it is not proper display error message to the terminal
									    not and whether it is properly used or not                                     |
										                    |                                                          |
															|                                                          |
								 If it is proper, shell interprets that command into Kernel                            |
								       understandable form and handover to the Kernel                                  |
										                    |                                                          |
															|                                                          |
									  Again $ prompt will be displayed to the terminal, <------------------------------+
										which indicated ready for the next command.
										
Types of Users in Linux:
------------------------
There are two types of users:
1. Normal Users -> $ prompt
2. Super users/root users -> # prompt

sudo -i ---> switch to super user. <SuperUserDO>

--------------------------------------
1. pwd: print working directory
2. ls: list out all files and directories
3. mkdir: to make a directory
4. cd: change directory
5. touch: to create and empty file
6. rmdir: to remove a directory
7. rm: to remove a file
8. cal: to display the current month calander
9. date: to display current date and time
10. help: to display list of available commands
11. clear: to clear terminal
12. exit: to logout the session
13. hello: to display brief system information
