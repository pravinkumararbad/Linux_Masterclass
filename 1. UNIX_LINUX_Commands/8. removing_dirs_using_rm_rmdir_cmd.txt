How to remove or delete the directories:
----------------------------------------

rmdir command:
--------------
1. We have to use rmdir to remove directories.
   rmdir dir1 -> To remove oen directory.
   rmdir dir1 dir2 dir3 -> To remove multiple directories.
   
2. rmdir will only work for empty directories, if the directory is not empty the rmdir command will not work.
   infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ mkdir dir1
   infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ touch dir1/{a..c}.txt
   infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ rmdir dir1
   rmdir: failed to remove dir1: Directory not empty.
   
   infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ rm -r dir1
   
   NOTE: In this scenario, when the directory is not empty we are required to use 'rm' command.
         rm command can be used to delete files and directories both, but rmdir command will work only for directories
         and directories should be empty.
         
         Whenever we are using rm to remove the directories we must use -r or -R (recursive)
         
NOTE: Once we remove a file or directory from Linux env. there is no way to retrieve that file.

Options used for rm command:
----------------------------
1. rm -i -> interactive
   While removing files and directories if we want to have a confirmation we have to use -i option.
   
   infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ rm -ri dir1
   rm: remove regular empty file 'dir1/a.txt'? y
   rm: remove regular empty file 'dir1/b.txt'? y
   rm: remove directory 'dir1'? y
   
2. rm -f -> force
   While removing files and directories, if we do not w ant any error message, then we should use -f.
   It is opposite to -i option.
   
   infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ rm -r dir1
   rm: cannot remove 'dir1': No such file or directory.
   
   infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ rm -rf dir1
   There will not be any error or notification, even if the directory is non existant.

3. rm -v -> verbose
   If we want to know the sequence ofteh removals on the terminal we should use -v.
   
   infodba@PravinUbuntu:~$ rm -rv dir1
   removed 'dir1/a.txt'
   removed 'dir1/b.txt'
   removed 'dir1/c.txt'
   removed directory 'dir1'
